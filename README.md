# stock2
This repository hosts notebooks I generated while practicing data analytics methods on stock research.
As you might have noticed, the name of the repository is 'stock2'.  The number '2' signifies that this is the second phase of my stock research.  I have used MATLAB for stock research prior to this phase.  The progress made in phase 1 is quite dispersed and the approach is also less systematic.  Work progresses generated from phase 1 of the research is hosted locally and not shared.
